    amber_ale = '''Like most amber beers, American amber ale is named after the golden to
        amber color this American version of English pale ale exhibits.
        The color is derived from the use of caramel and crystal malt additions,
        which are roasted to provide amber beers with the color,
        body and flavor many beer fans have come to appreciate.
        Falling under the ale beer type, amber ales ferment at
        warmer temperatures for what is typically a much shorter
        amount of time than lager style beers.
        American Amber Ale

        The American amber ale is one of the most widely enjoyed
        styles throughout the United States and serves as a cornerstone
        style of the American craft brewing revolution. American ambers
        are darker in color than their pale ale cousins, the presence
        of caramel and crystal malts lending a toasted, toffee flavor,
        along with the perception of a fuller body when compared to beers
        without such malts. Amber beer showcases a medium-high to high
        malt character with medium to low caramel character derived from
        the use of roasted crystal malts. The American amber is characterized
        by American-variety hops, which lend the amber ale notes of citrus,
        fruit and pine to balance the sweetness of the malt.

        As with many amber beer types, American amber ale is a highly
        versatile companion to American cuisine, particularly foods
        that are grilled or barbecued, as roasted malts complement seared,
        charred and caramelized proteins making
        this ale beer type a perennial favorite at backyard cookouts.
